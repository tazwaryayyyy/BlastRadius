# BlastRadius ⚡

> Pre-merge impact intelligence powered by IBM Bob.
> Know exactly what your PR will break — before it merges.

**Live Demo:** [https://blastradius-rosy.vercel.app/](https://blastradius-rosy.vercel.app/)
**API Base:** [https://blastradius-api.onrender.com](https://blastradius-api.onrender.com)

## What it does

BlastRadius gives every PR a **blast radius report**: a force-directed graph
showing every file your change can affect, ranked by risk level, with test
coverage gaps called out explicitly.

The core insight: existing tools (Copilot, Cursor, CodeRabbit) review *what
you wrote*. BlastRadius answers the question they can't: **what does merging
this affect downstream?**

---

## Why IBM Bob?

Traditional analyzers can be precise, but they take time to configure and usually end in reports nobody reads. BlastRadius turns the same question into a 30-second PR workflow engineers will actually use.

Bob holds the **entire repository in context simultaneously** so the output is fast, readable, and tied to the pull request instead of a separate analysis queue.

Specifically, Bob:
- Traces multi-hop call chains across the full codebase (not just direct imports)
- Flags lower-confidence paths explicitly when runtime wiring or dynamic dispatch requires manual verification
- Correlates changed symbols against the complete test suite to find coverage gaps
- Produces causal explanations — *why* a path is risky, not just *that* it exists

The value claim is speed, usability, and workflow integration: full-repo impact analysis in plain English, inside the PR, before merge.

## Quick start

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/blastradius.git
cd blastradius
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add your IBM Bob API key (or fallback LLM key)
```

### 2. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 3. Run locally (no Docker)

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
# Any static server works — no build step needed
cd frontend
npx serve .          # or python -m http.server 3000
```

## The demo script (2 minutes)

1. **Open the app** — three panels visible, graph is idle.
2. **Press "Run Demo"** — diff loads in the left panel. Bob starts streaming.
3. **Graph renders** — three chains radiate from the blue changed node.
4. **Point out the chains**:
   - Green node (LOW) — webhooks, safe, has tests
   - Yellow node (MEDIUM) — auth, partial risk, has tests
   - **Red pulsing node (CRITICAL) — billing, no tests**
5. **Click the red node** — right panel shows the full chain, confidence label, and no-test warning.
6. **Read the header** — the risk score spikes and the verdict blocks merge.
7. **Use the checklist** — suggested actions tell the reviewer what to do before merge.
8. **Punchline**: "We're not chasing rare disasters. We're catching the hidden breakages that cause 2am pages every week."

## BlastRadius vs existing tools

| Capability | BlastRadius | CodeRabbit | GitHub Copilot | Cursor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reviews code you wrote | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Traces downstream impact | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Multi-hop call graph tracing | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Test coverage gap detection | ✓ | Partial | ✗ | ✗ |
| Merge verdict with reasoning | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Full repo context simultaneously | ✓ (via Bob) | ✗ | ✗ | Partial |
| Works on any diff / any language | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Visual blast radius graph | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

The key distinction: every tool in this table tells you if your code is *good*. BlastRadius tells you if merging it is *safe*, fast enough to use on every PR, and clear enough that people will act on it.

## Troubleshooting

**Bob API returns 401**
Check `BOB_API_KEY` in `.env`. Make sure there are no trailing spaces or quotes around the key.

**Graph renders but shows no nodes**
Bob returned an empty `call_chains` array. This means the diff symbols weren't found in the repo files. Verify `repo_path` points to the correct directory and the diff file paths match the repo structure.

**SSE stream hangs / never completes**
Nginx is likely buffering the stream. Confirm `nginx.conf` has `proxy_buffering off` and `proxy_read_timeout 180s`. If running locally without nginx, the stream connects directly to FastAPI and this isn't an issue.

**`uvicorn: command not found` after install**
The venv wasn't activated. Run `source backend/.venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `backend\.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) before running uvicorn.

**Docker Compose: `port 8000 already in use`**
Another process is on port 8000. Either stop it (`lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill`) or change the port in `docker-compose.yml` and `frontend/app.js` (`window.API_BASE`).

**Bob fallback not triggering**
The fallback only activates if `BOB_API_URL` is set but unreachable, or returns a non-2xx error. If `BOB_API_URL` is empty, the fallback is used directly. Check logs for `"Bob primary failed"` to confirm fallback activation.

**Demo diff loads but analysis never finishes**
Bob's response is taking longer than `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (120s). Increase it in `bob_client.py` or check Bob API status.
